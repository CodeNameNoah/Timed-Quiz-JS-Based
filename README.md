# Timed-Quiz-JS-Based

I am pleased to share a description of a quiz application that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application showcases my proficiency in these technologies and highlights my ability to create dynamic and engaging web applications.

## Description

I am a skilled JavaScript developer with a passion for building practical and useful tools. Recently, I decided to put my skills to the test by building a random password generator that allows users to specify their desired criteria.

The quiz application features multiple-choice questions that test a user's knowledge on a range of topics. To make the quiz more challenging and interactive, I incorporated intervals and iterating loops to track time and iterate through the questions. The intervals ensure that the user has a set amount of time to answer each question, while the loops ensure that the application moves to the next question once the user has answered the current question.

The quiz application also features a user-friendly interface that is designed using CSS. The interface provides clear instructions on how to take the quiz and provides instant feedback to the user, making the experience both informative and enjoyable.

Additionally, the quiz application includes a score tracker that updates in real-time as the user answers each question, which helps the user track their progress and stay motivated. At the end of the quiz, the user can review their answers and see their final score.

Overall, this quiz application is an excellent example of my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my ability to create engaging, interactive, and dynamic web applications that test and challenge a user's knowledge.
