# Timed-Quiz-JS-Based
I have developed a quiz application using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript technologies. The application is designed to test a user's knowledge on various subjects and includes a timer that utilizes intervals to track the remaining time. It demonstrates my proficiency in working with JavaScript intervals to create dynamic web applications.
